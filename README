This repo contains a simple SCALA program for accepting a .csv file from the command 
line and transforming it from a comma and new line separated file to only a comma separated file. Basically it
eliminates the columns from a data table and leave a single row. 

An example implementation would look like:

> scala NewLineSep.scala <input file> <output filename>
