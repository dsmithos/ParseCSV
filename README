This repo contains a simple SCALA program for accepting a .csv file from the command 
line and transforming it from a comma and new line separated file to  just comma separated. Basically it
eliminates the columns from a data table and leaves a single row. The output will go into a new file so the original data
is intact. 

An example implementation would look like:

> scala NewLineSep.scala <input file> <output filename>
